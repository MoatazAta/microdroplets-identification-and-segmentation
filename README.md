# Microscopic Droplits Identification And Segmentation
 Final project in 4th year Software Engineer at SCE.
 <br />
Partnering with a senior professor  from the Hebrew University to coordinate a research project in deep learning developing a desktop application for identifying and segmenting water droplets on the surface of leaves, in additional allowing to train new models with new data. The new app will be installed in the lab for researchers and students which reduce the segmentation process from week to minuets.
This project accomplished a high percentage of accuracy (+98%).
